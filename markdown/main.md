### Bullshit as a service

> I think it's reality check time for OpenStack and that's long

### OpenStack and Linux

> Linux began as a hobby project; OpenStack began as a way to
> fundamentally change how cloud computing is delivered. Its growth
> and adoption rate have outperformed those of Linux by leaps and
> bounds. The development rate (in terms of commits) of OpenStack
> after only 4 years is similar to what Linux reached after about 15
> years.
